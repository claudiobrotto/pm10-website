The skills underlying the expertise of PM_TEN members and staff draw largely on a strong aptitude for problem solving and the activities carried out over the years have contributed to the consolidation of these peculiar characteristics allowing us to intervene successfully whenever it is necessary to adopt approaches non-ordinary for the management of complex problems. At the same time, the skills inherited from the years of collaboration with national and international research groups have made it possible to acquire expertise in the field of funded research and project development. This, mixed with the tension for innovation that has always been a characterizing element of the company, has pushed the researchers of PM_TEN to confront and acquire some innovative project solving techniques that go to complement the ordinary design support.
