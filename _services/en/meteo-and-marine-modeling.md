Our services concerning numerical modeling of both meteorological and marine fields are relative to simulations of atmospheric dynamics and ocean dynamics (waves and currents) by using state of the art modeling tools. The service features can be designed according to specific needs. They may include simulations on scales ranging from continental to local ones (up to a few hundred meters) both for forecasting purposes and for climatological analysis and/or reconstruction of past events.

### CLIMATOLOGICAL STUDIES AND SIMULATION OF PAST EVENTS
Climatological studies (statistical basis of at least ten years) exploiting mesoscale meteorological models, forced by global models (e.g. reanalysis), and reconstruction of past meteorological events in relation to different types of weather parameters, such as wind, precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, etc..

### DELIVERY ON AN OPERATIONAL BASIS OF METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS AT CONTINENTAL AND REGIONAL SCALES
Delivery of meteorological fields (pressure, wind, temperature, humidity, precipitation, solar radiation, etc.) on a (at least) daily basis for different forecast intervals on areas selected by the customer.

### VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION ATMOSPHERIC SIMULATIONS
Delivery of very high-resolution meteorological fields (forecast and/or climatological analysis) up to spatial resolution of a hundred meters by means of nesting both diagnostic wind models (e.g. mass-consistent) and prognostic models (e.g. Large-Eddy Simulations) into mesoscale meteorological models.

### PRODUCTION OF METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS TO STUDY THE DISPERSION OF POLLUTANTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Production of meteorological fields (mesoscale and/or high resolution) to be used by chemical transport and/or dispersion models.

### DELIVERY OF METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS TO SIMULATE THE FIRE PROPAGATION IN FORESTS
Delivery of mesoscale and/or high-resolution meteorological fields to be used as inputs for forest fire propagation simulations.

### OCEAN MODELING
Simulations of ocean currents and wave dynamics at the basin scales forced by mesoscale and/or high resolution meteorological models, both for forecast needs and for climatological studies.
