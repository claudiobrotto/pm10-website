Numerical simulations performed with mathematical models are now considered one of most important tool for the air quality analysis.  We can provide a complete service in this field, where models are developed and used to produce results on statistical analysis based on historical archives of passed events as far as implemented to get operational forecasting tools and evaluate hypotetical future scenarios.  Parameters characterizing the service are always defined in order to completely dress on customer needs and we are able to  supply for a large range of demand, starting from global scale analysis, passing through intermediate regional scale, till reaching the very local scale, in urban areas where the effects of single stack emissions as far as single road emissions  can be observed.

## SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS CONCENTRATIONS
Simualations of atmospheric pollutant dispersion. Different kind of emission sources including anthropogenic sources (roads, industries, area sources,...) and natural sources (dust, biogenic emissions,...) can be taken into account to produce pollutant concetration maps and give an analysis of air quality in the observed area for the period of interest. Atmospheric odor dispersion simulations.

## IMPACT ANALYSIS AND SOURCE APPORTIONMENT
Evaluation of emission sources impact on the air quality of selected areas and identification of main contribution using sophisticated source apportionment algorithms.

## ACCIDENTAL RELEASES IMPACT SIMULATIONS
Assesment of accidental releases impact on local and non-local air quality.

## SUPPORT ON IMPACT REDUCTION FOR PLANNED ACTIONS
Assesment of enviromental and infrastructural actions (planned and/or wating for endorsment) with respect to their impact on air quality. Comparison with current regulations, and identification of possible mitigation actions. Support to institutional structures in coordination with international and transboundary policies and identification of common strategies for air quality improvement.

## FUTURE SCENARIOS STUDY AND ANALYSIS
Analysis of future scenarios defined on the basis of socio-economic trend evalution. Emissions can be projected taking into account both single activities evolution (expected increase/decreas, displacement actions on industrial parks, production processes change and/or renewal,...) and large-scale socio-economic effects (urban expansion, changes in commercial flows,...)
